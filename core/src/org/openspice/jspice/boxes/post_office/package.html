This package is an initial draft for a messaging service (which may be made obsolete by JMS).  The
basic idea is that agents communicate asynchronously via 'letters' or, more accurately, letter
boxes.  The main point is that an agent may be an external process, an event driven thread or
an ordinary object and they can all participate in a single unified communication scheme.

External processes are modelled by a Reader/Writer pair.  This is undoubtedly a bit stupid as the
NIO model is much better.  However, I'd like to get this one nailed down.

Swing GUI processes are going to be a bit more challenging.  I don't know a lot about the way GUI's
work with threads.  Looks like I need SwingUtilities.invokeLater( Runnable ) to be invoked when
letters are available.  The notification of letter arrival can be generalized by the Observer/Observable
model.  I note that this has to be thread-safe.  Is Observer notification thread-safe?
