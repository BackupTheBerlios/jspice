This package is an initial draft for a messaging service (which may well be made obsolete by JMS).  The
basic idea is that threads communicate asynchronously via 'letters'.   However, the main point is to
allow both external processes and event-driven GUI threads to participate in a single unified scheme.

External processes are modelled by a Reader/Writer pair.  This is undoubtedly a bit stupid as the
NIO model is much better.  However, I'd like to get this one nailed down.

GUI processes are going to be a bit more challenging.  I don't know a lot about the way GUI's work with
threads.  Looks like I need SwingUtilities.invokeLater( Runnable ) to be invoked when letters are
available.  The notification of letter arrival can be generalized by the Observer/Observable model.  I note
that this has to be thread-safe.  Is Observer notification thread-safe?
